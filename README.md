# 🔐 AI Fraud Detection System

An AI-powered web application designed to **detect suspicious financial transactions** in real time using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes transaction patterns to identify potential fraud based on abnormal behavior such as high transaction amounts, unusual frequency, location mismatch, and device changes.  
It is suitable for **FinTech, banking, and digital payment platforms**.

## 📂 Features
- Detects fraudulent vs legitimate transactions  
- Generates fraud risk score (0–100)  
- Identifies unusual transaction patterns  
- Provides explainable AI-based decisions  
- Supports real-time transaction analysis  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript / React  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask / Django)  
- **AI/ML:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Database:** MySQL / MongoDB  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## 📊 Fraud Detection Parameters
- Transaction amount vs user average  
- Transaction frequency
